## Description
This repo contains some of my dissertation work for the MPhil in Machine Learning at the University of Cambridge. I'm working on Interpretable Machine Learning. The original repo is from [TCAV](https://github.com/tensorflow/tcav). This is currently a work in progress!

## Visualizing CAVs
CAVs, or concept activation vectors are training using example images that contain a particular concept of interest. Below are some example concepts for the *striped* concept class.
